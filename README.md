# Python & Tableau_World Happiness World Report Analysis (2008-2022)
Sourcing and Analyzing Open Data - Python analysis code and Tableau presentation for the open data.

# Introduction
The World Happiness Report is a survey of global happiness that is conducted by the United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network. The report ranks countries based on various indicators of happiness and well-being, including economic prosperity, social support, life expectancy, freedom to make life choices, charity, and perceptions of corruption.

# Objective
To understand the factors that influence happiness is crucial to creating policies and programs that can improve people's lives and gain insights into what makes people happy and satisfied with their lives.

# Hypothesis
As the GDP per Capita, Life Expectancy, and Social Support variables increase, the Happiness Score increases as well.

# Visulisation with Tableau
This storyboard doesnâ€™t contain every step I took as part of the analysis, only those relevant to the final results.
